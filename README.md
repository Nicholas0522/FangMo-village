Practise programming

Hello world!
My name is Nicholas Zhao, who come from Hangzhou China. Hope I can learn more knowledge about computer programming,
like python, visual basic, and javascript.
After few days, I will leave current company and work for one new company, both my boss and colleagues are very friendly
and energetic, I love them and also learn knowledge both in security technology and social intercourse.
Keep moving, just quote one phrase from Secretariat, 'You never know how far you can go unless you run'.
